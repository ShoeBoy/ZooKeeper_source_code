# Foreword



This reading note is for object-oriented programming course, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Beginning in September 2018, this course encourages students to analyze source code of various projects in the view of object-oriented programming. 

This reading note records my personal recognization of Apache ZooKeeper, a centralized service for distributed systems, providing namely distributed configuration service, synchronization service, and naming registry.

As an undergraduate computer science student, I detailedly type all the information I've searched for while finding out what this service is for, and how it works in different modes. Though I would regard the background descriptions as a necessary part of this note, I would set a single page, enabling experience programmers to skip that part. 

Comments and corrections are welcome. Please feel free to contact me at lishubo15@mails.ucas.ac.cn.
